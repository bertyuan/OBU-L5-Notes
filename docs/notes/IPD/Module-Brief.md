## Core Concepts of Innovative Product Development

### Project
A temporary endeavor to create a unique product or service.  
Focused on **"temporary"** and **"unique"** outcomes.  

### Product
A quantifiable artifact, often software or a system.  
This module emphasizes innovative product creation.  

### Value
The worth perceived by various stakeholders.  
Project outcomes must deliver tangible value.  

> [!TIP]
> Projects are part of a larger **"System for Value Delivery."**  
> This includes programs, portfolios, and operations.  

## Project Management Principles
- **Focus on Value:** Project success is defined by value delivery.  
- **Collaborative Team:** Fosters a strong team environment.  
- **Tailor to Context:** Adapt approaches to fit each project.  
- **Embrace Adaptability:** Be resilient to change.  

## Project Performance Domains
- Stakeholders  
- Team  
- Development Approach  
- Planning  
- Project Work  
- Delivery  
- Measurement  
- Uncertainty  

These 8 domains are interacting and interdependent.  
They form the structure of this module.  
Principles guide behavior, and performance domains cover practical areas.  

## Part A Preparation
Your journey to a successful **Part A project proposal** begins with careful planning in **Phase 1: Initial Preparation**.

### Determine Project Topic
Choose an innovative and feasible project idea from the provided list, or propose your own original concept.  
Ensure it aligns with the module's focus on product development.  

### Discuss with Peers & Mentors
While Part A is an individual assignment, engaging in discussions with classmates and mentors can provide valuable inspiration and fresh perspectives for your project idea.  

> [!TIP]
> This initial phase is critical and should take place **2–3 weeks before the submission deadline** to allow ample time for refinement.
